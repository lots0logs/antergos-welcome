          <h2>Antergos</h2>
          <p>Antergos is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> operating system. Within the Linux community, Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> itself is renowned for being an exceptionally fast, powerful, and lightweight distribution that provides access to the very latest cutting edge - and bleeding edge - software. However, Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> is also aimed at more experienced or technically-minded users. As such, it is generally considered to be beyond the reach of those who lack the technical expertise (or persistence) required to use it.</p>

          <p>Antergos provides all the benefits of the Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> operating system combined with a focus on user-friendliness and accessibility. Available in both 32 and 64 bit versions, Manjaro is suitable for newcomers as well as experienced Linux users. For newcomers, a user-friendly installer is provided, and the system itself is designed to work fully 'straight out of the box' with features including:</p>

          <p><ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Pre-installed desktop environments</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Pre-installed graphical applications to easily install software and update your system, and</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Pre-installed codecs to play multimedia files</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>For more experienced - and adventurous - users Antergos also offers the configurability and versatility to be shaped and moulded in every respect to suit personal taste and preference. Furthermore, a minimalist NET-Edition is also available in both 32 and 64 bit versions. Stripped of any pre-installed software, this provides a base installation on which to build your own system; starting from a command line, be completely free to chose your own greeters, desktops, hardware drivers, software applications, and so on!</p>

          <h2>But wait, there's more ...</h2>
          <p>Antergos shares many of the same features as Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>, including:

          <ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Speed, power, and efficiency</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Access to the very latest cutting and bleeding edge software</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>A 'rolling release' development model that provides the most up-to-date system possible without the need to install new versions, and</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Access to the Arch<a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> User Repository (AUR).</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>However, Antergos boasts a few extra features of its own, including:

          <ul class="icons clean">
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>A simplifed, <b>user-friendly installation process</b></li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Automatic detection</b> of your computer's <b>hardware</b> (e.g. graphics cards)</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Automatic installation of</b> the necessary <b>software</b> (e.g. graphics drivers) for your system</li>
            <li><i class="icon-check"></i>Its <b>own dedicated software repositories</b> to ensure delivery of fully tested and stable software packages, and</li>

            <li><i class="icon-check"></i><b>Pamac</b> makes it easy for you to install additional software and manage your applications.</li>

          </ul>
          <h2>Desktop Environments</h2>

          <p>There are several Desktop Environments and Window Managers available for Antergos, each with their own unique style, interface, and features. Furthermore, it is possible to install multiple environments if desired, which can be selected at the login screen at any time. Users are not resitricted to whatever comes pre-installed with a particular flavour of Antergos.</p>

          <p>How to install additional Desktop Environments is documented in our <a href="http://wiki.antergos.com/index.php?title=Install_Desktop_Environments">wiki</a>.</p>

          <h3>XFCE 4.10</h3>
          <p>Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly. Refer to the <a href="cmd://link?http://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1335571200">XFCE 4.10 Release Notes</a> for more details.</p>

          <h3>Openbox 3.5</h3>
          <p>Openbox is a highly configurable window manager. It allows you to change almost every aspect of how you interact with your desktop and invent completely new ways to use and control it. It can be like a video game for controlling windows. But Openbox can also be kept extremely simple, as it is in the default setup, meaning that it can suit just about anybody. Openbox gives you control without making you do everything. Refer to the <a href="cmd://link?http://openbox.org/">Openbox homepage</a> for more details.</p>
